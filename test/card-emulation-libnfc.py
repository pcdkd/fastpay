FastPay Card Emulation - using libnfc

This script uses the `libnfc` command-line tool `nfc-emulate-tag`
to perform card emulation. It is a simple, robust wrapper that outsources
the complex NFC protocol handling to the battle-tested libnfc library.

This approach was found to be a reliable alternative to Python-native libraries.
